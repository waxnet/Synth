# Synth

Synth is a tool that enables interaction between Lua and Selenium, allowing you to automate and control web browsers using Lua scripts in conjunction with C#'s web automation framework. Whether you're scripting browser interactions, testing web applications, or automating tasks, Synth provides an efficient solution by integrating Lua's simplicity with Selenium's capabilities.
